The Site facilitates communication between Third Party Service Providers, Network Participants, Visitors and potential users of associated Third Party Offerings. Some of the Third Party Service Providers that are accessible by and through the Directory Service pay a fee for inclusion in the Directory Service.</li> <li>The PestAppointment Offerings contain comments, opinions, statements, feedback and other content (collectively, "Feedback"), Listings, Content, Network Articles (as defined below), advertisements, responses, statements, promises and other information (collectively, "Site Content") that is provided directly by Third Party Service Providers, Network Participants, Visitors and any other parties that use the Site (collectively, "Site Users").

Please use caution and common sense when using the Site and Directory Service. PestAppointment in no way endorses the Site Content made available by Site Users through the Interactive Services, Directory Service, Resource Network and/or any other PestAppointment Offerings. The Site Content and other information submitted or made available by Site Users is not verified or reviewed in any way before it appears on the Site or otherwise through the PestAppointment Offerings. PestAppointment does not warrant the validity or accuracy of any such Site Content. Each Site User shall be solely responsible for the Site Content posted by and through the PestAppointment Offerings. PestAppointment reserves the right to prohibit any conduct by Site Users or remove any Site Content from the PestAppointment Offerings at any time and for any reason, in PestAppointment's sole discretion. The reasons for removal may include where PestAppointment believes that the Site Content posted by a Site User is unsuitable for the PestAppointment Offerings for any reason including, without limitation, where: (i) the Site Content contains or links to material that could be considered unlawful, harmful, threatening, defamatory, obscene, harassing or otherwise objectionable; (ii) the Site Content contains or links to material that infringes upon the trademark, trade name, service mark, copyright, license, or other intellectual property or proprietary right of any third party; (iii) PestAppointment believes that a Site User is, at any time, conducting any commercial activity by and through the Site; and/or (iv) PestAppointment believes that a Site User is in violation of the Agreement including, without limitation, Section 12 below.</li> <li>PestAppointment does not involve itself in the agreements arrived at by and between Visitors and Third Party Service Providers, or in the actual provision of Third Party Offerings in connection with the relationships created thereby. Therefore, PestAppointment does not make any representations regarding the competency, trustworthiness, honesty, integrity and/or behavior of either its Visitors or Third Party Service Providers. Visitors, and not PestAppointment, are solely responsible for assessing the competency, trustworthiness, honesty and integrity of all Third Party Service Providers that such Visitors contact via the Directory Service.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Terms Applicable to Attorney Listings.</strong> <ul class="list list-dash list-loose grid grid-cols-1"> <li>PestAppointment is not a law firm or a lawyer referral service. As such, PestAppointment offers no legal advice, recommendations, mediation or counseling in connection with any legal matter, under any circumstances, and nothing we do and no element of the Site, Directory Service or other PestAppointment Offerings should be construed as such. You should always check with your attorney, accountant and/or other advisors to be sure that any legal advice, law-related Third Party Offerings, law-related Site Content or other legal products and/or services available by and through the PestAppointment Offerings (collectively, "Legal Services") is/are appropriate for you.</li> <li>The Site provides paid attorney advertising to those attorneys that are registered as Third Party Service Providers ("Third Party Legal Professionals"). Some of the Third Party Legal Professionals that are accessible by and through the Directory Service pay a fee for inclusion in the Directory Service. PestAppointment does not receive any portion of any Third Party Legal Professional's fees.</li> <li>Any use of the Directory Service by Site Users is not intended to, and will not create, an attorney-client relationship between any such Site Users and PestAppointment. Without limiting the foregoing, any information submitted to PestAppointment and/or any electronic or other communication sent to PestAppointment will not create, or be covered by, an attorney-client relationship between Site Users and PestAppointment or any Third Party Legal Professionals.</li> <li>The Site facilitates communication between Third Party Legal Professionals and potential users of associated Legal Services. PestAppointment does not guarantee that Site Users will successfully find legal representation through the Directory Service. The determination of the need for legal services and the choice of legal representation are extremely important decisions and should not be based solely on advertisements, claims of expertise or cost offered by any Third Party Legal Professional.</li> <li>PestAppointment does not review the standing of any Third Party Legal Professionals with any regulatory authority or bar association. Therefore, PestAppointment makes no representation regarding the status, standing or ability of any Third Party Legal Professional. When considering retaining a Third Party Legal Professional, Site Users should ask for free background information from that Third Party Legal Professional and check that Third Party Legal Professional's standing with the applicable state bar association. PestAppointment is not responsible for, and in no way endorses, any description or indication of specialization or limitation of practice by any Third Party Legal Professionals that are accessible through the Directory Service. Please be aware that no agency or board may have certified such Third Party Legal Professional as a specialist or expert in any indicated field of law practice. In addition, a Third Party Legal Professional claiming specialization is not necessarily any more expert or competent than other legal professionals. Site Users should make an independent investigation, confirm and verify all claims made by Third Party Legal Professionals. Site Users are encouraged to use caution when reviewing any information submitted by Third Party Legal Professionals. Except where otherwise indicated, the Third Party Legal Professionals are not certified by the Florida State Bar Board of Legal Specialization and Education, the Texas State Board of Legal Specialization ("Not Certified by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization"), or any other entity or body.</li> <li>Laws vary across legal jurisdictions and may be subject to interpretation by different courts. Laws are also very specific to individual facts and circumstances, and the law-related Site Content may not fit your particular circumstance. The law-related Site Content is provided for informational purposes only, and may not reflect current legal developments or variances in the law of different jurisdictions. The law-related Site Content does not necessarily reflect the opinions of any Third Party Legal Professionals, their partners, clients or affiliates.</li> <li>Certain Listings and other law-related Site Content may include descriptions of successful lawsuits brought by Third Party Legal Professionals. These descriptions are not meant to create any unjustified expectations that similar results can be obtained for others, because each case is determined on its own specific factual and legal circumstances. No Third Party Legal Professional can guarantee the success of a case, and past successes, even in very similar lawsuits, do not mean that success in a subsequent case is guaranteed or even likely. Results depend upon a variety of factors unique to each case. <p class="mt-6">

<strong>Dispute Resolution Provisions.</strong>The Agreement shall be treated as though it were executed and performed in Delaware and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to conflict of law principles).<p class="mt-6">
<strong>You hereby agree to arbitrate all claims that may arise under the Agreement that you may have against PestAppointment or any of the Covered Parties, who are express third-party beneficiaries of the mandatory arbitration provision. Without limiting the foregoing, should a dispute arise between you and PestAppointment and/or any Covered Party including, without limitation, any matter concerning the PestAppointment Offerings, terms and conditions of the Agreement or the breach of same by any party hereto: (a) the parties agree to submit their dispute for resolution by arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (the â€œAAAâ€) in Delaware or the county of your residence, in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration rules of the AAA; and (b) you agree to first commence a formal dispute proceeding by completing and submitting an Initial Dispute Notice which can be found&nbsp;<a href="http://assets.elocal.com.s3.amazonaws.com/DisputeResolutionProvision.pdf">here.</a>We may choose to provide you with a final written settlement offer after receiving your Initial Dispute Notice ("Final Settlement Offer"). If we provide you with a Final Settlement Offer and you do not accept it, or we cannot otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute, but you still wish to proceed with your dispute, you must submit your dispute for resolution by arbitration before the AAA as set forth above, by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration, which is available<a href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004177">here.</a>For claims of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions. If the arbitrator awards you relief that is greater than our Final Settlement Offer, then we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration and, if you retained an attorney to represent you in connection with the arbitration, we will reimburse any reasonable attorneys' fees that your attorney accrued for investigating, preparing and pursuing the claim in arbitration. Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive to the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Although we may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we will not seek such an award from you unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.</strong>
</p> <p class="mt-6">
<strong>To the extent permitted by law, you agree that you will not bring, join or participate in any class action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy that you may have against PestAppointment and/or any Covered Party. You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in the suit. You agree to pay the attorney's fees and court costs that PestAppointment and/or any Covered Party incurs in seeking such relief. This provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits: (i) does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights or remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above; and (ii) is an independent agreement. You may opt-out of these dispute resolution provisions by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first access the Site.</strong>

</li> <li>
<strong>Miscellaneous.</strong>Should any part of the Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. To the extent that anything in or associated with any PestAppointment Offerings is in conflict or inconsistent with the Agreement, the Agreement shall take precedence. Our failure to enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision. The parties do not intend that any agency or partnership relationship be created through operation of the Agreement. PestAppointment may assign its rights and obligations under the Agreement, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice to you. The Agreement may not, however, be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under it.
